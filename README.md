A small 2 player game I wrote while doing some boring maintanance on the main computer :).

To play, download and run index.html in your favorite browser.

	Thrust     = Up Arrow Key
	Turn Right = Right Arrow Key
	Turn Left  = Left Arrow Key
	Fire       = Shift (Option on Mac)

Player 2 Controls: 

	Thrust     = "W" Key 
	Turn Right = "D" Key
	Turn Left  = "A" Key 
	Fire       = "F" Key
